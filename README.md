# Flameflow Dashboard Hub

# Build Flameflow — Independent Project Management Dashboard

## 1. Product overview

Build a polished, production-quality frontend for **Flameflow**, an independent project management and application administration dashboard.

Flameflow is a platform where each software project has its own dedicated management dashboard. The dashboard is inspired by the clean, minimal SaaS administration experience of Base44, with a similar layout, visual hierarchy, navigation style, card design, and interaction patterns.

The reference screenshot attached to this prompt shows the visual direction.

**Important:** Build an original Flameflow product interface, not a literal Base44 clone. Use the reference for layout and visual inspiration. Do not use Base44's logo, branding, trademarks, proprietary assets, or copied text.

The dashboard will eventually manage software projects built by Flameflow, including:

* Accounting applications.
* ERP applications.
* Inventory management.
* Logistics software.
* Maritime management systems.
* AI-native applications.
* Workflow automation products.
* Custom client software.

The first project to display is:

**NGO Ledger**

This is a streamlined expense tracking application for NGOs.

The dashboard must be designed as a reusable project management shell. The same frontend should work for NGO Ledger, Retail Accounting, Logistics Management, Maritime Operations, and future projects by changing the project configuration and backend connection.

---

# 2. Primary objective

Create a complete frontend-only project management console that feels like a credible, modern SaaS administration product.

The user should be able to:

* View project overview.
* Manage project users.
* Inspect simulated database collections and records.
* View analytics.
* Manage SEO and GEO settings.
* Configure domains.
* Manage integrations.
* Manage security settings.
* Manage AI agents.
* Manage workflows.
* View system logs.
* Inspect mock API documentation.
* Manage project settings.
* Manage MCP servers.
* Share the project with collaborators.

The application should feel cohesive across all sections.

Do not create a collection of unrelated pages. Every section must use the same design system and application shell.

---

# 3. Reference screenshot and visual direction

Use the attached Base44-style screenshot as the primary visual reference for the initial Overview page.

The screenshot demonstrates:

* A permanent left sidebar.
* A search box at the top.
* A vertical navigation menu.
* A selected Overview item.
* A large, spacious main content area.
* Project logo and project name.
* Edit icons.
* Project description.
* Project creation metadata.
* Favorite icon.
* Action buttons.
* Two-column cards.
* Full-width card below.
* Subtle borders.
* Rounded corners.
* Very light neutral background.
* Black typography.
* Muted accent colors.
* Minimal visual noise.

Reproduce the **layout proportions, spacing, visual density, and design language** as closely as practical while using original Flameflow branding.

The first screen must feel like a polished project administration dashboard, not a generic admin template.

Do not add unnecessary charts, marketing banners, large hero sections, or decorative illustrations to the initial Overview page.

---

# 4. Technology requirements

Use the following stack where supported by the Lovable environment:

* React.
* TypeScript.
* Tailwind CSS.
* shadcn/ui.
* Lucide React icons.
* TanStack Router.
* React Hook Form.
* Zod.
* A supported charting library such as Recharts, if available.
* Local mock data.
* Local state and local persistence.

If the existing Lovable project uses a slightly different supported setup, preserve the existing environment while meeting the functional requirements.

## Frontend-only scope

For this implementation:

* Do not connect a real database.
* Do not create a real backend.
* Do not implement real authentication.
* Do not implement real billing or payments.
* Do not send real invitation emails.
* Do not connect real external integrations.
* Do not deploy applications.
* Do not connect real domains.
* Do not execute real API requests.
* Do not connect real MCP servers.
* Do not expose real credentials or secrets.

Use realistic mock data and simulated interactions.

Create clean interfaces and service abstractions so real backend integrations can be added later.

---

# 5. Application shell and layout

Create a full-screen dashboard application shell.

The application consists of:

1. Left project navigation sidebar.
2. Main dashboard content area.

## Desktop layout

* Sidebar width approximately 320px, matching the reference's visual proportions.
* Sidebar stays visible while navigating.
* Thin vertical divider on the sidebar's right edge.
* Main content fills the remaining width.
* Main content has generous horizontal and vertical padding.
* Main content is scrollable.
* Use a clean, spacious layout rather than a dense enterprise admin interface.

## Responsive layout

### Desktop

* Persistent sidebar.
* Two-column overview cards.
* Full dashboard layout.

### Tablet

* Sidebar remains usable or collapses appropriately.
* Main content adjusts to available width.
* Two-column cards may stack when space is limited.

### Mobile

* Sidebar becomes a slide-over drawer.
* Add a menu button in the main header.
* Main content uses full width.
* Cards stack vertically.
* Header elements wrap naturally.
* Tables become responsive with horizontal scrolling inside their own containers where necessary.
* No page-level horizontal overflow.

Ensure the application works at:

* 320px mobile width.
* 768px tablet width.
* 1024px desktop width.
* Large desktop widths.

Do not use fixed viewport-height layouts that create clipped content.

# 6. Design system

## Brand

Product name:

Flameflow

Use Flameflow in the interface where appropriate.

The current project is:

NGO Ledger

## Visual personality

* Minimal.
* Modern.
* Professional.
* Calm.
* High-quality SaaS.

---

# 7. Sidebar navigation

Build a permanent left sidebar inspired by the reference screenshot.

## Search

At the top of the sidebar, include a search field.

Placeholder:

Search...

Requirements:

* Search icon on the left.
* Rounded rectangular input.
* Light background.
* Subtle border.
* Comfortable height.
* Gray placeholder.
* Focus ring using the accent color.

Search should filter navigation items.

Example:

* “user” → Users.
* “database” → Database.
* “workflow” → Workflows.
* “api” → API.
* “seo” → SEO & GEO.

If there are no results, show:

No results found

## Navigation items

Use this exact order:

1. Overview
2. Users
3. Database
4. Analytics
5. SEO & GEO
6. Domain
7. Integrations
8. Security
9. Agents
10. Workflows
11. Logs
12. API
13. Settings
14. MCP

Each item must have:

* Lucide icon.
* Text label.
* Rounded hover state.
* Active state.
* Keyboard focus state.
* Consistent vertical spacing.

Suggested icons:

* Overview — House.
* Users — Users.
* Database — Database.
* Analytics — ChartNoAxesCombined.
* SEO & GEO — Search or Globe.
* Domain — Globe.
* Integrations — Plug.
* Security — ShieldCheck.
* Agents — Bot.
* Workflows — GitBranch.
* Logs — History.
* API — Braces.
* Settings — Settings.
* MCP — Cable or Network.

Use the closest available icon if necessary.

## Active state

The selected navigation item should use:

* Soft warm gray background.
* Dark text.
* Slightly stronger font weight.
* Rounded corners.

Do not use a bright blue active background.

The active state must update when navigating.

## Sidebar footer

At the bottom, reserve space for:

* Flameflow branding.
* Current project identifier.
* Environment label.
* Optional account menu placeholder.

Keep the footer subtle.

---

# 8. Routing and nested dashboard navigation

Use TanStack Router search parameters or nested frontend state.

The selected dashboard section must be linkable, refreshable, and preserved in the URL.

Preferred structure:

```text
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=overview
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=users
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=database
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=analytics
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=seo
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=domain
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=integrations
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=security
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=agents
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=workflows
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=logs
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=api
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=settings
/dashboard?projectId=ngo-ledger&section=mcp
```

Use typed route search parameters where supported.

Requirements:

* Sidebar navigation updates the URL.
* Refreshing the page preserves the selected section.
* Browser back and forward work.
* Invalid section values fall back to Overview.
* Project ID is preserved when switching sections.
* Each section has a clear page title.
* Navigation does not require a full page reload.

Do not use separate unrelated application shells for each page.

---

# 9. Project configuration architecture

This is a critical requirement.

The dashboard must not be hardcoded exclusively for NGO Ledger.

Create a centralized typed project configuration.

Example:

```ts
type ProjectConfig = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  logoUrl?: string;
  createdAt: string;
  visibility: "public" | "private" | "team" | "restricted";
  isFavorite: boolean;
  badgeVisible: boolean;
  previewUrl: string;
  environment: "development" | "staging" | "production";
  deploymentStatus: "deployed" | "building" | "failed" | "not_deployed";
  backendUrl?: string;
};
```

Default project:

```ts
const ngoLedgerProject: ProjectConfig = {
  id: "ngo-ledger",
  name: "NGO Ledger",
  description:
    "A streamlined expense tracking tool designed for NGOs to manage project costs, categorize spending, and maintain financial transparency.",
  createdAt: "2026-08-14",
  visibility: "public",
  isFavorite: false,
  badgeVisible: true,
  previewUrl: "https://ngo-ledger.flameflow.local",
  environment: "production",
  deploymentStatus: "deployed",
};
```

Use the project configuration everywhere:

* Project header.
* Project name.
* Description.
* Logo.
* Preview URL.
* Visibility.
* Favorite state.
* Project settings.
* Share link.
* Analytics labels.
* API configuration.
* Agents.
* Workflows.
* Logs.

Do not duplicate project information in multiple components.

---

# 10. Independent project backend abstraction

The dashboard is frontend-only for now, but it must be structured for independent backend connections.

Create a mock project backend provider or repository.

Example:

```ts
interface ProjectBackend {
  getProject(): Promise<ProjectConfig>;
  updateProject(
    updates: Partial<ProjectConfig>
  ): Promise<ProjectConfig>;

  getUsers(): Promise<User[]>;
  getDatabaseCollections(): Promise<DataCollection[]>;
  getAnalytics(): Promise<AnalyticsData>;
  getAgents(): Promise<Agent[]>;
  getWorkflows(): Promise<Workflow[]>;
  getLogs(): Promise<LogEntry[]>;
}
```

Implement a local mock provider.

Each project should eventually be able to have:

* Its own project ID.
* Its own backend URL.
* Its own database.
* Its own users.
* Its own analytics.
* Its own agents.
* Its own workflows.
* Its own API configuration.
* Its own security settings.

For now, all of this is simulated locally.

The frontend should not need to be rewritten when real project backends are connected later.

---

# 11. Project header

Create a project header similar to the reference screenshot.

The header should appear at the top of the main content area.

3. Responsive sidebar.
4. Project header.
5. Overview page.
6. Users page.
7. Database page.
8. Analytics page.
9. SEO & GEO page.
10. Domain page.
11. Integrations page.
12. Security page.
13. Agents page.
14. Workflows page.
15. Logs page.
16. API page.
17. Settings page.
18. MCP page.
19. Share modal.
20. Mock backend provider.
21. Centralized project configuration.
22. Local state and persistence.
23. React Hook Form and Zod validation.

26. Accessible and responsive design.

---

# 35. Final quality instruction

Build this as a serious, production-quality SaaS project management console.

The visual quality of the Overview page is the highest priority.

Do not make it look like a generic dashboard template.

Use the attached reference screenshot to match:

* Sidebar proportions.
* Header hierarchy.
* Card structure.
* Button styling.
* Spacing.
* Typography.
* Borders.
* Neutral background.
* Overall visual density.

Use original Flameflow branding.

Start by building and refining the Overview page until it looks excellent. Then implement the remaining dashboard sections using the same design system.

The finished frontend must feel like an independent project management dashboard that can eventually connect to separate backends for each software project.

**Do not build a real backend in this task. Build the complete frontend and the architecture for future backend integration.**
